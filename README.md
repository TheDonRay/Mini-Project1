ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, meet CalmLine!

Iâ€™m an aspiring Backend Engineer passionate about mastering JavaScript by building hands-on mini projects that strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals.

For the first Mini-project of many, Iâ€™ve created a simple Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that helps users manage and organize stressful situations they might be facing. It takes user input, processes it, and helps structure your thoughts in a more organized and mindful way â€” a small step toward combining tech and mental well-being.
